    "Biography":"Ningura Napurrula was born at Watulka, south of Kiwirrkura, Western Australia c.1938. She is the widow of Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi, a highly respected Pintupi elder who held significant knowledge of his country’s dreaming stories. They had lived in the desert until meeting up with a welfare patrol led by Jeremy Long, re-settling Indigenous people from the area where the British atomic bomb tests were to be carried out. Together with their young son Maurice, they went in to the newly built Papunya Community. Ningura now lives in Kintore with her family. Ningura’s husband Yala Yala was a founding member of the Papunya Tula Artists’ Group. Ningura also paints for Papunya Tula Pty Ltd. Ningura participated in a collaborative painting with senior Pintupi women which was included in the Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney, 2000. \n Ningura depicts the mythological events of her ancestors. Her artworks focus on the travels of her female ancestors, the sacred sites that they passed, and the mythological significance of the bush food that they collected. In mythological times, one old woman, Kutunga Napanangka, passed through this site during her travels towards the east. She passed through numerous sites along the way before arriving at the permanent water site of Muruntji, south west of Mt. Leibig. These travels and rituals help to explain the current customs and the ceremonial lives of these Pintupi women. "
