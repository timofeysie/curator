    "Biography":"Also known as Tilipangitingimirri , John Boscoe trained as a potter at Bagot Ceramics Unit in Darwin. With Eddie Puruntatameri, he was the founder of the Tiwi Pottery on Bathurst Island. \n At first working in stoneware, he later took up earthenware, with Tipiloura becoming interested in all-over abstract designs. He moved to Munupi to assist Puruntatameri's son Robert in the pottery. For a time, he worked with visiting Swiss potter Claude Presset, learning European techniques. Illness forced him to return to Bathurst Island where he is now a deacon in the Catholic Church. His work, which is held in national and international collections, is marked JBT (painted or incised)."
