	"Biography":" Ally  began  painting  during  the CAAMA  -  A  Summer  Project of  1988/89  when  acrylic painting  was  introduced  to  her  home  region  of  Utopia.  Though  far  from  prolific,  Ally steadily painted up until her death in 2007. Her simplistic paintings reflected the Anwekety, small  black  conkerberries  that  grow  after  good  rain.  They  are  found abundantly  in  certain areas of Utopia, particularly where she called home. Ally  lived  in  a  family  community  where  many  members  were  artists;  primarily  painting with  some  sculpture.  Some  of  these  family  members  include  Glady Kemarre,  Angelina Pwerle and Polly and Kathleen Ngale whom all paint for Mbantua Gallery. With her art, Ally tried to teach the wider world about her paintings and the Anwekety that features in them. "
