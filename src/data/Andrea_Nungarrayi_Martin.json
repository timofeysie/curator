	"Biography":" Andrea Nungarrayi Martin is a member of a family recognized for its artistic achievements. Clifford Tjapaltjarri Possum was her uncle and many of her family are at Yuendumu, painting. She has achieved widespread recognition for her work and has exhibited in Perth, Alice Springs, Darwin, Canberra, Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. Her works are in the Museé National des Arts Africains et Oceaniens, Paris, South Australian Museum, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Flinders University and Gantner Myer Foundation. The John Kluge (Kluge Foundation, USA) commissioned a major work ‘Karrku Jukurrpa’ by twenty nine women (including Andrea) and five men from Yuendumu. This enormous work (380 x 680 cm), which is in the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia, has similar broad structural characteristics to those found in Warlukulangu Jukurrpa, though the actual composition and the dreaming which inspired the work are quite different.
