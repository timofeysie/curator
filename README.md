A micro-library of functions to manage artists and thier paintings.

The GitHub repo is called curator, but the npm repo is named art-curator since curator already exists as an npm module.
We do unit testing with Mocha and Chai.  Conventional commits are done with commitizen.  The releases are automated with semantic-release.  Tests are automatically run before commits with ghooks.  Code coverage is recorded with Istanbul.  Badges are added to the README with shields.io.  ES6 support is added with Babel.  Travis is used for continuous deployment.

Bump the version with the sufix -beta.0. Ex: 1.3.1-beta.3.  As usual, commit the code, add a new tag, push to GitHub, push the tags, publish to NPM with â€“tag beta . 
```
